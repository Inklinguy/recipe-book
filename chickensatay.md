### Instructions

1. **Marinate the Chicken**

   * Mix all marinade ingredients in a bowl. Add chicken strips, toss well, cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (up to overnight for best flavor).

2. **Prepare the Peanut Sauce**

   * In a small saucepan over medium heat, whisk together peanut butter, soy sauce, vinegar/lime juice, sugar, curry paste, and coconut milk.
   * Stir until smooth and slightly thickened (add more water if too thick). Set aside.

3. **Cook the Chicken**

   * Thread chicken strips onto soaked wooden skewers.
   * Grill over medium-high heat (or use a grill pan or broiler) 3–4 minutes per side until cooked through and slightly charred.

4. **Serve**

   * Arrange skewers on a plate, drizzle with a little peanut sauce, and serve the rest on the side for dipping.
   * Garnish with chopped peanuts, cilantro, and lime wedges.

👉 Great with cucumber salad and jasmine rice on the side.

Do you want me to also give you a **quick oven-broiled version** (in case you don’t want to grill)?
